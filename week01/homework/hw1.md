## Question 1
``` 1
 Guest Additions are device drivers and system applications that make operating system perform better, they are usually meant to install inside a virtual machine. Enabling Guest Additions made a pop with an installation option of VBox_Gas6.0.0.
```
## Question 2
```2 
My computing experience is more aligned with the "Windows Culture" because this class is really my first time using linux. I've used both macOS, OSX, and windows my whole life. I also prefer a nice GUI than text based interface even if the text based might be faster or better. Nice looking applications are easily likable.
```
## Question 3
```3 
The first article left me feeling like the author was just ranting about command line and being too harsh (a doctorate person using bullshit just felt wrong), but towards the end when he clears up some concerns, his frustration was warrented and genuine. It made me think if there was a way to make the command line experience optional. The second article seems like a well thought out response to command line usage and its impact on students. It's not bullshit but useful and they should learn it.
